	<p class="fact"><em>During certain times of the year, a single adult blue whale consumes about 4 tons of krill a day.</em></p>
	<ul>
		<li><span><strong>Average Length:</strong></span> 100ft</li>
		<li><span><strong>Scientific Name:</strong></span> Balaenoptera musculus</li>
		<li><span><strong>Average Lifespan:</strong></span> 80-110 Years</li>
		<li><span><strong>Habitat:</strong></span> North Atlantic and Pacific Ocean</li>
		<p>Everyone knows that blue whales are big, but did you know that they are the largest animal known to man? Weighing in at 200 tonnes (441,000ibs) these beast's tongues alone weigh as much as an elephant! With a body like that the sound blue whales make is comparable. A blue whale can be heard by others from a staggering <em>1,000 miles away!</em></p>
